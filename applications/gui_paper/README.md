**FIXME: After updating `countries.json` change the date of the last row in
`table_tact.py` and `plot_effective_growth.py`**


# `request_country.py`

* Create a symlink to `main.py` from `korali-apps:5.coronavirus/main.py`

# TODO

* [ ] write a more detailed outline,
* [ ] finalize the model and code
* [ ] form a list of neighboring countries (maybe all Europe)
* [ ] run the model on the countires
* [ ] digitize data from fig.3
* [ ] learn how to plot distributions of parameters from korali samples
* [ ] learn how to draw neighboring countries with arbitrary colors using geopandas
* [ ] make a style for plots of daily and total infected compared to data
* [ ] confidence 90%
* [ ] scatter plot of intervention time and growth factor

Geographical distribution of the effect
